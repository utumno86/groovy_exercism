# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```plain
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```


For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/groovy).

Run the tests by executing the test script.

```
$ groovy ./WordCountSpec.groovy
```

After the first test(s) pass, continue by commenting out or removing the `@Ignore` annotations prepending other tests.

When all tests pass, congratulations!
